The data is used solely for analytical and educational purposes and does not represent actual Blinkit business data.

5. Features / Highlights
Business Problem
Blinkit needs a clear analytical view to track sales performance across different outlet types, locations, sizes, and product categories. Raw transactional data makes it difficult to identify high-performing outlets, customer preferences, and sales trends over time.

Goal of the Dashboard
The goal of this dashboard is to provide a centralized view of key business KPIs such as total sales, average sales, number of items sold, and customer ratings. It helps stakeholders quickly compare outlet performance, product demand, and location-wise contribution.

Walkthrough of Key Visuals
KPI Cards display core performance metrics including Total Sales ($1.20M), Average Sales ($141), Number of Items (8,523), and Average Rating (3.9), providing a quick snapshot of overall business health.

Outlet Establishment Trend (Line Chart) shows sales growth over the years, highlighting a peak around 2018 and a slight decline afterward, useful for understanding expansion impact and market saturation.

Fat Content Analysis (Donut Chart) compares sales contribution from Low Fat and Regular products, indicating higher revenue generation from low-fat items.

Item Type Performance (Bar Chart) ranks product categories by total sales, with fruits & vegetables, snacks, and household items emerging as top contributors.

Outlet Size Distribution (Donut Chart) illustrates sales share across Small, Medium, and High outlet sizes, where Medium-sized outlets generate the highest revenue.

Outlet Location Analysis (Bar Chart) compares sales across Tier 1, Tier 2, and Tier 3 cities, showing Tier 3 locations as the strongest performers.

Outlet Type Performance (Table) provides a detailed comparison of outlet types based on total sales, number of items, average sales, ratings, and item visibility, highlighting Supermarket Type 1 as the top-performing outlet type.

Interactive Filters (Slicers) allow users to dynamically analyze data by outlet location, outlet size, and item type for deeper insights.

Business Impact & Insights
The analysis reveals that Tier 3 locations and medium-sized outlets contribute the highest sales. Supermarket Type 1 dominates total revenue and item volume, while low-fat products generate higher overall sales. These insights can support better inventory planning, outlet expansion strategy, and category-level optimization.
