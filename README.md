🚀 Features & Highlights
🔹 Business Problem

Blinkit generates large volumes of transactional data across multiple outlets, locations, and product categories. Without proper analytics, it becomes difficult to identify high-performing outlets, customer preferences, and long-term sales trends.

🔹 Goal of the Dashboard

The goal of this dashboard is to provide a centralized and interactive view of key business KPIs such as total sales, average sales, number of items sold, and customer ratings. It enables stakeholders to quickly evaluate performance across outlets, locations, and product categories.

🔹 Walkthrough of Key Visuals

KPI Cards display Total Sales ($1.20M), Average Sales ($141), Number of Items (8,523), and Average Rating (3.9), offering a quick snapshot of overall business performance.

Outlet Establishment Trend (Line Chart) shows sales trends over time, highlighting peak performance around 2018 and a slight decline afterward.

Fat Content Analysis (Donut Chart) compares sales contribution from Low Fat and Regular products, showing higher revenue from low-fat items.

Item Type Performance (Bar Chart) ranks product categories by total sales, with fruits & vegetables, snacks, and household items as top contributors.
